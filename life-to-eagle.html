<!--TROOP 228 LIFE TO EAGLE RESOURCES

The links and resources in this area will help the Life Scout negotiate through the procedures and requirements to attain the rank of “Eagle”.

EAGLE BINDER – A three-ring binder which will ultimately house all documentation relating to your Eagle project and Eagle Rank Application.

You choose how thick it is according to your needs
Guidance for arrangement of documents in the binder may be found here.
When the application package (see below) is returned to the Scout after the Board of Review, all contents may be returned to the binder.
APPLICATION PACKAGE – The application package is a set of specific documents which are extracted from your 3-ring Eagle binder and forwarded to Council for approval.

The Eagle applicant and the assigned Eagle Counselor will review the Council’s Eagle Application checklist to ensure that the application is complete
The Council Eagle Rank application process as well as the Application Checklist may be found here.
Included in the Application Package:
“Contacts” page from the Proposal section of Eagle Service Project Workbook.
Eagle Rank Application (see below)
Eagle Service Project Workbook (see below)
Statement of Ambition and Life Purpose (see below)
Package should be enclosed in a Council-approved envelope with the preprinted checklist completed (Eagle Counselor will provide the envelope)
Not to be included in the Application Package:
Recommendation letters from your references
Three ring binder
Miscellaneous correspondence and documentation (e.g., emails with the beneficiary, receipts, volunteer sign-in logs. etc.)
CHECKLIST FOR EAGLE SCOUT PROGRESS (LINK)- This checklist has three parts:

Merit Badges and time-in-rank requirements
Rank application and final approvals
Eagle Service Project
The checklist is meant to be a tool. Its use is not required, nor should it be submitted with your Eagle Rank application package.

SERVICE PROJECT IDEAS – Try to develop a project idea that interests you. Still stumped?

Some project ideas can be found here.
Go on line and Google “Eagle Scout Projects”
EAGLE SCOUT SERVICE PROJECT WORKBOOK (Link to Workbook Instructions) – The Service Project Workbook is a required part of the Eagle’s project write-up and binder. It should be completed electronically and then printed. All completed parts, with the exception of the Introduction and Overview, must be included in the Eagle Rank Application package. There are four parts to the workbook:

There are four parts to the workbook:

1. Introduction and Overview (a lot of useful information provided here)

2. Project Proposal

The Proposal is completed after you have informally discussed your project idea with the benefitting organization.
The Proposal need not be overly-detailed, but it should give the audience a clear understanding of what you hope to accomplish.
Be sure to electronically include “before photos” if this makes sense within the context of your project.
You will arrange with the Troop Committee to present the Proposal for approval at a Committee meeting.
Several days before your presentation, you should email a copy of the file with your completed Proposal.
Once the Proposal is approved, you must obtain the four required signatures on the last page before beginning your project.
You may wish to provide the Project beneficiary with “Information for Project Beneficiaries”, found here.
3. Project Final Plan 

Once the Proposal is fully approved you should develop the Final Plan. It is a detailed description of how you will proceed with each step of every phase of your project.
Think well ahead and plan for materials, tools, safety, transportation, refreshments, clean-up, etc.
Ideally, you will plan distinct teams and team leaders for each phase of your project. Be prepared to provide each team leader the instructions and resources needed for his/her responsibilities in your project.
4. Project Report 

This document captures your overview of how the project went. Try to complete every field.
Note that electronic photos are encouraged in this document. Add as many as you deem appropriate (“before” and “after”, perhaps).
Signatures on the last page are required from you and from the benefitting organization.
CONTACTS – The “Contacts” page is found in the Project Proposal section of the Eagle Scout Service Project Workbook and all applicable fields should be completed. The final version should be at the top of your Eagle Rank application package.

EAGLE SCOUT RANK APPLICATION (LINK) – It is highly recommended that the application be completed online.

Note that much of the merit badge information and required dates may be easily obtained from TroopMaster or from the Troop Advancement Coordinator.
Requirement #2 – References should be some of the same people who were requested to provide a letter of recommendation. (see LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION below)
Requirement #6 – Completed at your Scoutmaster Conference.
Requirement #7 – Eagle Board of Review and statement of Ambitions and Life Purpose.
Signatures from you, the Scoutmaster and the Committee Chair are required on the back of the form.
LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION (Template) – Your assigned Eagle Counselor will provide his/her contact information for your references.

At least six letters of recommendation are required. This link takes you to a file which can be tailored to the individual Scout by entering in the appropriate areas:
Print an adequate number of copies (6-10) to be mailed or hand-delivered. It is suggested that 10 requests for recommendations be sent to ensure that at least six are received back.
It is highly recommended that, as a courtesy, a pre-addressed stamped envelope be included when mailing out the form. The address on the return envelope should be for the Eagle Counselor. Under no circumstances should the letter of recommendation be returned to the Scout or to the Scout’s family.
STATEMENT OF AMBITION AND LIFE PURPOSE – Requirement #7 on the Eagle Scout Rank Application

Guidance is provided here.
Include with your application package.
RECOGNITION FOR EAGLE SCOUTS (Parents, take note…) – Becoming an Eagle Scout is a big deal and people want to acknowledge it.

The National Eagle Scout Association (NESA) will provide a certificate and wallet card through the Council; no action required on your part.
A special Eagle Court of Honor may be convened to honor the Scout. The Scout and his family are responsible for arranging this. (The Troop, of course, is happy to offer advice and assistance.)
If they are notified, the Morton Grove American Legion will send a representative to the Eagle Court of Honor to acclaim your accomplishment. (Check with the Troop Advancement Coordinator for contact information)
Many celebrities and political leaders will send a letter of congratulations if you reach out to them.
Illinois Senators will provide a U.S. flag certified to have been flown over the U.S. Capitol along with a certificate.-->
